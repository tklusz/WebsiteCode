				<h3 class="section-subtitle">Aledade Inc.</h3>
				<h3 class="section-subtitle">Reducing Toil</h3>
				<div class="exp-grid">
					<div class="exp-grid-description">
						<p class="big-paragraph">
							Refactored a large codebase that manages all of our databases. Increased transparency
							compared to previous iteration of the script.
							Reduced code footprint of our databases by 100,000 lines. Created new automation to
							automatically sync user's Active Directory roles with
							database roles. Integrates with Snowflake + Permifrost. Introduced and implemented
							Terragrunt for database management.
						</p>
						<p class="big-paragraph">
							Created a Python script that integrates with multiple vendor's APIs for automated user
							removal when a user leaves the company.
							Reduces toil of previous manual user management process (which took around an hour per user
							to delete).
						</p>
					</div>

				<!-- Experience blurb @ Aledade -->
				<h3 class="section-subtitle">Static Code Analysis</h3>
				<div class="exp-grid">
					<div class="exp-grid-description">
						<p class="big-paragraph">
							Leading a project to host Sonarqube on AWS EKS.
						</p>
						<p class="big-paragraph">
							Created parallel deployments in production and nonproduction EKS clusters. Created RDS
							Postgres databases connected to the cluster.
							Leveraged Terraform for infrastructure creation across all projects.
						</p>
						<p class="big-paragraph">
							Configured Bamboo and Bitbucket plugins to run static code analysis automatically when a
							pull request is created, report the outcome onto the pull request in Bitbucket, and back in
							Sonarqube.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<!-- Experience blurb @ Aledade -->
				<h3 class="section-subtitle">Improving our Deployments</h3>
				<div class="exp-grid">
					<div class="exp-grid-description">
						<p class="big-paragraph">
							Implemented a blue-green deployment for our highest-traffic production application to reduce
							30 seconds of downtime to 0 whenever a new version is deployed.
						</p>
						<p class="big-paragraph">
							Used an Ansible playbook to bring up a parallel deployment with automatic rollback,
							functionally eliminating downtime for the application whenever a new version is deployed.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<!-- Experience blurb @ Aledade -->
				<h3 class="section-subtitle">Pinpointing Spend</h3>
				<div class="exp-grid">
					<div class="exp-grid-description">
						<p class="big-paragraph">
							Created a Python function for AWS Lambda to automatically tag snapshots to match their EBS
							volume counterparts.
						</p>
						<p class="big-paragraph">
							Untagged snapshots were responsible for 90% of untraced spend on AWS on the
							day of the script. After the script ran, all of the spend was properly tagged under each
							project.
						</p>
						<p class="big-paragraph">
							6,500 snapshots initially changed, with 250+ additionally being tagged by the script each
							day.
						</p>

				<h3 class="section-subtitle">Modernizing our Codebase</h3>

					<div class="exp-grid-description">
						<p class="big-paragraph">
							Worked with another engineer to refactor a large internal Python CLI tool used for Postgres
							database administration.
						</p>
						<p class="big-paragraph">
							Wrote unit and functional tests for the new code using Pytest.

				<h3 class="section-subtitle">Migrated local servers to AWS</h3>
				<div class="exp-grid">
					<div class="exp-grid-description">
						<p class="big-paragraph">
							One of my primary responsibilities included migrating on-premise applications to AWS EKS and
							EC2.
						</p>
						<p class="big-paragraph">
							Two major migrations I completed were PSI's business rules engine and SSO solution.
							These were both migrated from an on-premise DC/OS cluster to AWS EKS, including creation of
							RDS databases with secret rotation, and Kubernetes secrets.
						</p>
						<p class="big-paragraph">
							Migrated production and nonproduction Jira instances from on-premise virtualized
							servers to AWS EC2 using Packer and Terraform. The databases were also moved from on-prem to
							RDS Postgres.
						</p>
						<p class="big-paragraph">
							Containerized and migrated various in-house Java TomEE servers from virtual servers to
							DC/OS.
						</p>
						<p class="big-paragraph">
							All infrastructure was created as code using Terraform, and deployed to 2-5 environments
							depending on the application.

				<!-- Experience blurb @ PSI -->
				<h3 class="section-subtitle">Implemented Continuous Integration and Delivery</h3>
				<div class="exp-grid">
					<div class="exp-grid-description">
						<p class="big-paragraph">
							As a part of these migrations, CI-CD pipelines were also created.
							Jenkins was used with a company-wide shared library and additional groovy scripts for
							building
							apps.
							As a part of this process, Dockerfiles were built, and apps were deployed via Buildmaster
							using Helm charts or plain Kubernetes charts.
							Buildmaster also allowed for Bash and Powershell scripts, which I also leveraged as a part
							of
							the pipelines.
						</p>
						<p class="big-paragraph">
							Created various CI-CD pipelines for new and existing applications, which previously required
							manual deployment.

				<h3 class="section-subtitle">Substantial improvements to Monitoring and Alerting</h3>
				<div class="exp-grid">
					<div class="exp-grid-description">
						<p class="big-paragraph">
							Implemented a monitoring solution for 200+ websites and servers. The websites are
							monitored via HTTP requests, while the servers each have an agent. Agents were installed via
							Rundeck. Agents were installed on both Windows and Linux machines. Some of these servers
							required custom Python and Nagios plugins, which I also created.
						</p>
						<p class="big-paragraph">
							Migrated the monitoring solution away from Icinga, with no downtime required and no lapse of
							monitoring between solutions.
						</p>
						<p class="big-paragraph">
							Leveraged OpsGenie as a solution for alerting and on-call rotation. The OpsGenie
							integration was also set up to create a Jira ticket whenever a high priority alert was
							created.
