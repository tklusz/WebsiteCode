# WebsiteCode
WIP responsive website using HTML, CSS. and Font Awesome for Icons.

My current website is up [here](https://tylerdevops.com). It's using a Hugo theme which has its limitations. As a result (and for more front-end web development experience) I'm creating my own.

The code will be fairly basic to begin with, but I may add on additional JavaScript code and libraries in future.
